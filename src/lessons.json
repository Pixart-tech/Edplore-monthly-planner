This reinforces body parts identification, which is a component of General Awareness. The EVS source explicitly lists body parts like Shoulder, Knee, Foot, Toes, Thumb, Fingers, Elbow, Wrist, Heel, and Thigh.\n^More Activities/Examples:^ Sing \"Ten Little Fingers\" or another physical rhyme to promote fine motor engagement.",
